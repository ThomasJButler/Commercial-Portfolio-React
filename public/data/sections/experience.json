I've always had a passion for learning and figuring things out. Some of my best early tech memories involve jailbreaking an original iPod Touch (iOS 1.1.4) with Cydia, messing around with custom repos, apps, and themes. It opened up a whole new world for me, and if I have one regret, it's not diving deeper into development sooner. Luckily, my interest in tech never faded. Over time, I got a clearer sense of what I wanted to do and finally committed to software development. Now, I have got the background knowledge, the mindset, and the drive to make it happen."
