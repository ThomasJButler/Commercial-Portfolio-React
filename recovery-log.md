# Git Recovery Log

## Recovery Started: 2025-07-04

### Initial State
- **Problem**: Production regression after 1.0.9 merge (Education, Skills, Portfolio pages broken)
- **Root Cause**: Rushed changes without proper testing, Git UI freeze led to merge confusion
- **Production Status**: Rolled back to stable deployment on Vercel ✅

### Recovery Strategy
Clean rollback to v1.0.5 with controlled reintegration of valuable features.

## Phase 1: Safety Backup ✅
1. Created backup branch from v1.1 work
   ```bash
   git checkout -b backup-v1.1-work
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Backup: v1.1 work including social links, animations, and improvements"
   ```
   - Commit: a595ded
   - Preserved: All current work including IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md

2. Rolled back to stable v1.0.5
   ```bash
   git checkout e55a87d -b dev-rollback-1.0.5
   ```
   - Now on clean base from merge PR #7 (2025-01-15)

## Phase 2: Feature Reintegration (In Progress)

## Next Steps
