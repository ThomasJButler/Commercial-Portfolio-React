# Current Work Session - Upstream Improvements

## Current Status
- **Date**: July 2025
- **Branch**: dev-rollback-1.0.5
- **Task**: Applying selected upstream improvements from UPSTREAM_IMPROVEMENTS_ANALYSIS.md
- **Sites**: 
  - Your site: https://www.thomasjbutler.me/
  - Upstream v2.0: https://ryanbalieiro.github.io/react-portfolio-template/

## Implementation Plan

### High Priority - Mobile Bug Fixes
These will improve your site's mobile experience:
1. **Fix mobile flickering** (commits: bd26d7d, 0294d7d)
2. **Fix ArticleInfoList height issues** (commit: 8d33e31)
3. **Improve touch sensitivity** (commit: 8cd54f5)
4. **Fix timeline padding on phones** (commit: 4eebf09)

### Medium Priority - UX Features
1. **Theme change spinner** (commit: 9b0e8c1) - Shows loading during theme switch
2. **YouTube link handling** (commit: 28dab21) - Better external link management

### Skip These
- **PrimeIcons** - You already use FontAwesome
- **V2.0 visual refresh** - Too extensive, would override your customizations
- **Color changes** - Unless you want the new color scheme

## Analysis: Key Differences (Your Site vs Upstream v2.0)

### 1. Visual Design
- Upstream had a complete visual refresh in v2.0 (May 2025)
- New color schemes for dark/light themes
- Updated layout and spacing

### 2. Icons
- Upstream uses PrimeIcons (you use FontAwesome)
- This is why you got the build error earlier

### 3. Mobile Experience
- Several mobile bug fixes in upstream
- Better touch sensitivity
- Fixed flickering issues

### 4. Features
- Theme change spinner (upstream has, you don't)
- Better YouTube link handling
- Enhanced localization support

## Next Steps
1. Add upstream remote if not exists:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ryanbalieiro/react-portfolio-template.git
   git fetch upstream main
   ```

2. Apply mobile bug fixes one by one:
   ```bash
   # View what changed
   git show bd26d7d
   
   # Cherry-pick if compatible
   git cherry-pick bd26d7d
   ```

3. Test each fix on mobile devices

4. Document what we've applied

## Continuation Prompt

To continue from this exact point, use this prompt:

```
I'm continuing work on my React portfolio project. I'm currently on the dev-rollback-1.0.5 branch and about to apply upstream improvements from ryanbalieiro/react-portfolio-template.

Context:
- I've already merged feature/performance-seo improvements into dev-rollback-1.0.5
- I've submitted PR #9 to upstream with my improvements
- I have UPSTREAM_IMPROVEMENTS_ANALYSIS.md documenting all upstream changes
- I've identified high-priority mobile bug fixes to apply (bd26d7d, 0294d7d, 8d33e31, 8cd54f5, 4eebf09)

Please continue by:
1. Checking if upstream remote exists
2. Starting to apply the mobile bug fixes from the high priority list
3. Testing each change before moving to the next

Reference CURRENT_WORK_SESSION.md for the full plan and analysis.
